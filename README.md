# CNN Library for SystemVerilog

SytemVerilog implementation of Alpha-Data CNN example originally in VHDL

## Original

The original VHDL and whitepaper can be found here:
ftp://ftp.alpha-data.com/pub/appnotes/cnn/

### Prerequisites

SystemVerilog Simulator:
Commercial (free): altera modelsim or Vivado simulator
Commercial (non-free): VCS, Questa, Modelsim, Aldec, Incisive(?)
Free: verilator (requires System-C testbench, not currently implemented or tested)

FPGA (Eventually):
Xilinx SOC: Zynq, Zynq Ultrascale+ (preferred)
Altera SOC

Software side: TBD
